# HR-Attrition-Dashboard
## Project Objective
**The purpose of this project is to create an interactive HR Attrition Dashboard that helps analyze employee attrition in an organization.The dashboard provides actionable insights into how employees leave the company based on key parameters like gender, age, performance, job role, and education. This can be used by HR to improve employee retention strategies.**
## KPIs Used
**What is the overall attrition rate? -Which gender has a higher attrition rate? -Which age group has the highest attrition? -Which job roles experience the most attrition? -What is the department-wise attrition rate? -Does education level affect attrition rates? -Is there a difference in attrition between high and low performers? -Does business travel frequency affect employee attrition? -How does distance from work affect employee attrition? -What is the ratio of active to attrition employees?**
## Process
**-Data Collection: Employee information including demographics, job roles, performance, education, and attrition data. -Data Cleaning: Processed the dataset to remove missing or inconsistent data. -Dashboard Development: - Used Excel for visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and filters. - Added key metrics such as total employees, attrition rate, and active employees. -Visualization Features: - Gender filter to view attrition by male/female employees. - Department filter (HR, R&D, Sales) to analyze department-wise attrition. - Attrition based on performance, education level, and business travel frequency. - KPI cards for quick insights on total employees and attrition rates.**

**The HR Attrition Dashboard provides key insights into employee attrition to help improve retention strategies:**

**-Overall Attrition Rate: 34% of employees left, with 66% still active. -Gender Analysis: Male attrition is higher (65%) compared to female (35%). -Age Group: The 26-35 age group shows the highest attrition (32 employees). -Job Role: Highest attrition occurs among Laboratory Technicians (26) and Sales Executives (20). -Department: R&D faces the most attrition (72%), indicating a need for intervention. -Performance: 79 high-performing employees left, a concern for business productivity. -Education: Bachelor’s and Master’s degree holders have the highest attrition. -Business Travel: Employees who travel rarely (76) leave more often than frequent travelers. -Work Distance: Surprisingly, most attrition comes from employees living near the workplace.**

## Conclusion
**-The HR Attrition Dashboard reveals high attrition among male employees, the 26-35 age group, and key roles like Laboratory Technicians. The R&D department faces the highest turnover, requiring immediate attention. To reduce attrition, the company should focus on improving conditions in R&D, engaging mid-career professionals, and retaining high performers through incentives and development opportunities.**

**-This dashboard is a valuable tool for making data-driven decisions to improve employee retention and satisfaction.**
